# Frequently Asked Questions
Q: "Is this compatible with ____ ?"

A: FreddyBracken (and my other client side mods) are compatible with most mods! Yes, it works with Skinwalkers and Mimics. 

The only incomptaible mods are other client-sided mods that specifically target the Bracken (or coilhead, for my endo mod, or the masked for my springtrap mod)
