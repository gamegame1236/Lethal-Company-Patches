# All Moons Are Now Freeeeee
* All moons are priced at 0 (free)
* All items remain the same price and are not modified
* Client side meaning you can join any game and the moons will be free for you!
* Should theoretically work with any custom/modded moons as long as the moon is setup the same as the default moons
