# Company Creatures v0.1.0
### Adds Mushrooms that can infect players with a deafening disease

## How does it works ?
<details>
  <summary>Don't read if you want to discover by yourself :</summary>
Mushrooms spawn inside the facility, going too close to one of them can infect you with a disease that renders you deaf to your coworker's voices.
Be careful, the infection can spread to nearby humans !

You can change the config file to modify the infection time and spawn chances of the mushrooms.
