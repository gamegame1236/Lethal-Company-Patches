# CustomTelevisionVideo
Adds the option to set a custom television video. The audio plays, too!<br>
If you don't like the video that I graciously provided, you can now set the video filepath in the config!<br>
You can specify absolute or local paths. Use forward slashes in your path.<br>
Local filepaths should not start with a slash, are local to the BepInEx/plugins/ directory.<br>
The default path is "FlipMods-CustomTelevisionVideo/television_video.mp4"<br>
The above is a local path, so the path will seen as ".../BepInEx/plugins/FlipMods-CustomTelevisionVideo/television_video.mp4"<br>
This currently only supports .mp4 files, but that may change in the future.
