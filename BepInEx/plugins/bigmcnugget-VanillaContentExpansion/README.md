# VANILLA CONTENT EXPANSION
An immersive, vanilla style content mod for Lethal Company that expands on the base game, currently adds 50 new scrap items that fit in with the games art style and themes. I eventually plan on adding a ton more scrap, new monsters, new map dangers, possibly new dungeons and moons

All models and textures are custom made by myself.
