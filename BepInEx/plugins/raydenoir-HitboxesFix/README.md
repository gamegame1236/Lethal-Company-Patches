Reverts v45 changes of crawler and spider hitboxes to allow you safely jump over them and stand on the bars.

## Installation

Just put the /BepInEx/ folder inside your /steamapps/common/Lethal Company/ folder after installing all the dependecies. (It doesn't mess up or delete your files, just copies the mod folder inside your plugins.)

## Config

Generated after launching the game for the first time.

You can revert only one of the changes, pretty obvious.

## Roadmap

Join my discord! I would be delighted to hear any silly mod ideas.
